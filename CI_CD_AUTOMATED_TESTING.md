# CI/CD Automated Testing Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the automated testing implementation for the Chronas API CI/CD pipeline. The system automatically runs comprehensive Postman tests after each successful Lambda deployment to ensure the API is functioning correctly.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Pipeline Integration

The automated testing is integrated into the AWS CodeBuild pipeline (`LambdaDeploymentStack`) and executes in the `post_build` phase after successful deployment.

#### Pipeline Flow:
1. **Code Push** → Triggers CodeBuild webhook
2. **Build Phase** → Deploys Lambda function (new or update)
3. **Post-Build Phase** → Runs automated tests
4. **Reporting** → Generates test reports and artifacts

### 2. Test Execution Scripts

#### Primary Scripts:

**`scripts/ci-lambda-postman-tests.js`**
- Main CI/CD testing script for deployed Lambda functions
- Automatically discovers API Gateway endpoint from CloudFormation
- Waits for API to be ready before testing
- Runs comprehensive Postman test suite
- Generates detailed reports and summaries

**`scripts/validate-lambda-deployment.js`**
- Pre-test validation script
- Validates basic API endpoints (health, welcome, version)
- Ensures Lambda deployment is healthy before running full tests
- Quick smoke test for immediate feedback

#### Supporting Scripts:

**`scripts/run-postman-tests.js`**
- General Postman test runner (local/dev/prod environments)
- Handles server lifecycle for local testing
- Supports multiple collections and environments

**`scripts/ci-postman-tests.js`**
- CI-specific test runner for local environments
- Used for pre-deployment testing

### 3. Test Collections

#### Available Collections:
- **Enhanced Collection** (`chronas-enhanced.postman_collection.json`)
  - Comprehensive API testing with 34+ requests
  - Authentication flows (JWT, OAuth)
  - CRUD operations for all endpoints
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Performance validation

- **Basic Collection** (`chronas.postman_collection.json`)
  - Core functionality testing
  - Essential endpoints only
  - Faster execution for quick validation

#### Environment Configuration:
- **Dynamic Environment Creation**: The CI script automatically creates a temporary environment file with the deployed API Gateway endpoint
- **Timeout Configuration**: Extended timeouts for Lambda cold starts
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanisms for transient failures

### 4. Test Reporting

#### Generated Artifacts:
- **JSON Reports**: `test-results/postman-lambda-ci-{collection}.json`
- **HTML Reports**: `test-results/postman-lambda-ci-{collection}.html`
- **Test Summaries**: `test-results/lambda-test-summary-{collection}.json`

#### Report Contents:
- Total requests and assertions
- Pass/fail statistics
- Response times and performance metrics
- Detailed failure information
- API endpoint information
- Execution timestamps

### 5. CodeBuild Configuration

#### Environment Variables:
```yaml
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: eu-west-1
NODE_VERSION: 22
CI: true
NODE_ENV: test
```

#### Build Phases:

**Install Phase:**
- Node.js 22 runtime setup
- Build tools installation
- CDK CLI installation

**Pre-Build Phase:**
- Dependency installation
- Repository cloning
- Environment preparation

**Build Phase:**
- Lambda deployment (new or update)
- Stack detection and conditional logic
- Function code updates

**Post-Build Phase:**
- Deployment validation
- Automated Postman testing
- Report generation
- Artifact collection

#### Reports Configuration:
```yaml
reports:
  deployment-test-reports:
    files:
      - test-results/postman-lambda-ci-*.json
      - test-results/lambda-test-summary-*.json
      - postman-results-*.json
      - postman-results-*.html
    base-directory: chronas-api
```

### 6. NPM Scripts

#### Available Commands:
```bash
# CI/CD Lambda testing
npm run test:ci:lambda          # Run enhanced tests against deployed Lambda
npm run test:ci:lambda:basic    # Run basic tests against deployed Lambda

# Deployment validation
npm run validate:lambda         # Validate Lambda deployment health

# Local testing
npm run test:postman           # Run tests against local server
npm run test:postman:dev       # Run tests against dev environment
npm run test:ci                # Run CI tests locally
```

### 7. Error Handling and Resilience

#### Failure Handling:
- **Non-blocking**: Test failures don't prevent deployment completion
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error reporting for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues pipeline execution even if tests fail
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files and resources

#### Retry Logic:
- **API Readiness**: Up to 30 attempts with 2-second delays
- **Request Timeouts**: 15-second timeout for individual requests
- **Connection Handling**: Robust error handling for network issues

### 8. Performance Considerations

#### Optimization Features:
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel where possible
- **Bail on Failure**: Option to stop on first failure for faster feedback
- **Selective Testing**: Ability to run basic vs. enhanced test suites
- **Caching**: Reuse of newman installation and dependencies

#### Timing:
- **Validation**: ~10-30 seconds
- **Basic Tests**: ~1-2 minutes
- **Enhanced Tests**: ~3-5 minutes
- **Total Overhead**: ~5-7 minutes added to deployment pipeline

### 9. Monitoring and Alerting

#### Success Criteria:
- All requests return expected status codes
- All assertions pass
- Response times within acceptable limits
- No authentication failures

#### Failure Scenarios:
- API Gateway endpoint not accessible
- Lambda function errors or timeouts
- Authentication/authorization failures
- Data validation errors
- Performance degradation

### 10. Usage Examples

#### Manual Execution:
```bash
# Test deployed Lambda with enhanced collection
node scripts/ci-lambda-postman-tests.js enhanced

# Test specific stack and region
node scripts/ci-lambda-postman-tests.js enhanced MyStack us-west-2

# Validate deployment only
node scripts/validate-lambda-deployment.js
```

#### CI/CD Integration:
The tests run automatically on every push to the `feature/modernize-api` branch that triggers the CodeBuild pipeline.

### 11. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

**API Not Ready:**
- Increase wait time in validation script
- Check Lambda function logs in CloudWatch
- Verify API Gateway configuration

**Test Failures:**
- Check test results in HTML reports
- Verify environment configuration
- Review API response data

**Permission Issues:**
- Ensure CodeBuild role has necessary permissions
- Check VPC and security group configurations
- Verify Secrets Manager access

#### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check stack outputs
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ChronasApiLambdaStackV2 --region eu-west-1

# Test API manually
curl -s https://your-api-gateway-url/v1/health

# Run tests with verbose output
npx newman run PostmanTests/chronas-enhanced.postman_collection.json -e env.json --verbose
```
